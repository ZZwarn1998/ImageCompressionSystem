# Image Compression System

&emsp;This is a simple Image Compression System which has the function of network communication. If you just want to have a look at the process of image compression and decompression, go to `main.py` file and click ***run button*** to start. If you want to use network communication, you should do like this. After you run `Client.py` and `Server.py`, you should designate IP address and Port of target server for `Client.py`.  Next,   just type command and then you can achieve the goal of network communication.
